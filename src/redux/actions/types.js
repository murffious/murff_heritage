// Why is this file beneficial?
//= =====================
// It is often claimed that constants are unnecessary, and for small projects, this might be correct.
// For larger projects, there are some benefits to defining action types as constants:

// It helps keep the naming consistent because all action types are gathered in a single place.
// Sometimes you want to see all existing actions before working on a new feature. 
// It may be that the action you need was already added by somebody on the team, but you didnâ€™t know.
// The list of action types that were added, removed, and changed in a Pull Request helps everyone 
//  on the team keep track of scope and implementation of new features.
// If you make a typo when importing an action constant, you will get undefined (prevents ReferenceError). 
// This is much easier to notice than a typo when you wonder why nothing happens when the action is dispatched.
